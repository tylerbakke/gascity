// Package runproj projects the dashboard run view from a city's append-only
// event log (.gc/events.jsonl) — the OSS-local analog of the hosted ClickHouse
// run projection. It folds bead lifecycle events into the latest bead snapshot
// per id and (in later phases) builds the RunSummary and run-detail off that
// fold, so the run view no longer scans the beads molecule history.
//
// Layering: this is object-model-layer code. It depends only on internal/beads
// and internal/events, never on the API or CLI layers, so the same projection
// can back any consumer.
